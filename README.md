FISSA
=====

FISSA (Fast Image Source Separation Analysis) is a Python library for extracting
somatic signals from 2-photon calcium imaging data.
It requires images in tiff format as well as predefined ROIs around somas. 

FISSA offers the use of ICA and several NMF algorithms to do so, as well as 
ROI manipulation routines for generating neuropil ROIs. 

Currently, FISSA is only available for Python 2.7, and has been tested on
Ubuntu 15.04 and on Windows 7 with the
[WinPython 2.7.10.3](http://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_2.7/2.7.10.3/)
distribution.

If you encounter a specific problem please
[open a new issue](https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/issues/new).
For general discussion and help with installation or setup, please see the
[Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/rochefort-lab/fissa).


Installation
------------

### Installation on Linux

Before installing FISSA, you will need to make sure you have all of its dependencies
(and the dependencies of its dependencies) installed.

Here we will outline how to do all of these steps, assuming you already have both
Python 2.7 and pip installed. It is highly likely that your Linux distribution ships with these.

#### Dependencies of dependencies

* To install the developmental version of FISSA, you will need to have
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) installed.

* [scipy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy/) requires a
  [Fortran compiler and BLAS/LAPACK/ATLAS](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/building/linux.html#installation-from-source).

* [shapely](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely) requires GEOS.

* [Pillow>=3.0.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/3.0.0) requires a
  [JPEG library](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/3.0.x/installation.html#external-libraries).
  Alternatively, you can install
  [Pillow 2.9.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.9.0),
  which we also support.

These packages can be installed on *Debian/Ubuntu* with the following shell
commands.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install gfortran libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-dev libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev
```

#### Installation into user site-packages

You can download the package source from GitHub, and then install FISSA and its 
dependencies as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa.git
pip install --user -r fissa/requirements_first.txt
pip install --user -r fissa/requirements.txt
pip install --user -e fissa
```

The `--user` flag ensures the packages are installed into your usr site-packages
folder.

To generate the plots in the iPython Notebooks, you will also need to install
the optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install --user -r fissa/requirements_plots.txt
```

#### Installation into a virtual environment

If you prefer, you can install FISSA and its dependencies into a python
[virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).
This is useful if you want to isolate FISSA and its dependencies into their own
place where they won't be affected if you install other packages.

```bash
PATH_TO_VENV="venvfissa"
PYTHON_VERSION="2.7"
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv --no-site-packages -p "/usr/bin/python$PYTHON_VERSION" "$PATH_TO_VENV"
source "$PATH_TO_VENV/bin/activate"
git clone https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa.git
pip install -r fissa/requirements_first.txt
pip install -r fissa/requirements.txt
pip install -r fissa/requirements_plots.txt
pip install -e fissa
py.test fissa
deactivate
```

You will need to source the virtual environment bin order to have FISSA and
its dependencies available. Once you are done you can deactivate the virtual
environment again.

```bash
source "$PATH_TO_VENV/bin/activate"
ipython
# Do something in python
# ...
deactivate
```

You can replace `$PATH_TO_VENV` with the literal path to your virtual
environment.


### Installation on Windows

These instructions for installing FISSA on Windows assume you are using
WinPython for your Python environment, and has been tested with
WinPython 2.7.10.3, available from
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_2.7/2.7.10.3/>.

From the `WinPython Command Prompt.exe`, which can be found in the WinPython
installation folder, you can download the FISSA source from GitHub and install
most of its dependencies as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa.git
pip install -r fissa/requirements_first.txt
pip install -r fissa/requirements_windows.txt
pip install -r fissa/requirements_plots.txt
```

If you don't have Git installed globally, you can't do all these steps in the
WinPython command prompt.
You can instead download a zipped copy of FISSA from GitHub and skip the first
step.

Next, you need to download a windows specific version of shapely from
<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely>.
Browse to where you downloaded the wheel (which should be named something like
`Shapely‑1.5.13‑cp27‑none‑win_amd64.whl`) and pip install it using the WinPython
command prompt:

```
pip install filename
```

Finally, if everything above worked well, you can install FISSA as 
follows (from the folder above fissa).

```
pip install -e fissa
```

### Testing your installation

After installing FISSA, you can test your installation by running the test
suite by running the command

```bash
python setup.py test
```


Folder Structure
----------------

### doc
Contains example code. You can load the notebooks as .ipynb directly in GitHub, 
or on your system if you know how to use ipython notebooks 
(http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/notebook/index.html). 
You can also read the .html pages instead. 

### exampleData
Contains example data. It has two zips with region of interests from ImageJ. 
It also contains three tiff stacks, which have been downsampled and cropped 
from full data from the Rochefort lab. 

### fissa
Contains the toolbox. See the tutorial in doc for how to use it, and the
comments in the different modules inside FISSA.
