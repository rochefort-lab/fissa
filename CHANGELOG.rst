Fixed
~~~~~

-   Allow ``deltaf.findBaselineF0`` to run with fewer than 90 samples, by reducing the pad-length if necessary.
    (`#62 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/62>`__)
-   Basic usage notebook wasn't supplying the correct ``datahandler_custom`` argument for the custom datahandler (it was using ``datahandler`` instead, which is incorrect; this was silently ignored previously but will now trigger an error).
    (`#62 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/62>`__)
-   Use ``ncores_preparation`` for perparation step, not ``ncores_separation``.
    (`#59 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/59>`__)

    (`#59 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/59>`__)
-   Allow both byte strings and unicode strings to be arguments of functions which require strings.
    Previously, byte strings were required on Python 2.7 and unicode strings on Python 3.
