Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter a problem when implementing or using FISSA, we want to
hear about it!

Gitter
~~~~~~

To get help resolving implementation difficulties, or similar one-off
problems, please ask for help on our `gitter
channel <https://gitter.im/rochefort-lab/fissa>`__.

Reporting Bugs and Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you experience a bug, please report it by opening a `new
issue <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/issues/new>`__. When
reporting issues, please include code that reproduces the issue and
whenever possible, an image that demonstrates the issue. The best
reproductions are self-contained scripts with minimal dependencies.

Make sure you mention the following things:

-  What did you do?
-  What did you expect to happen?
-  What actually happened?
-  What versions of FISSA and Python are you using, and on which
   operating system?

Feature requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a new feature or enhancement to an existing feature you
would like to see implemented, please check the list of `existing
issues <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/issues>`__ and if you
can't find it make a `new
issue <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/issues/new>`__ to request
it. If you do find it in the list, you can post a comment saying ``+1``
(or ``:+1:`` if you are a fan of emoticons) to indicate your support for
this feature.

Documentation
-------------

We are glad to accept any sort of documentation: function docstrings,
tutorials, Jupyter notebooks demonstrating implementation details, etc.

reStructuredText documents and notebooks live in the source code
repository under the ``docs`` directory.

Docstrings
~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation for classes and functions should follow the `format
prescribed for
numpy <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard>`__.

A complete example of this is available
`here <https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example_numpy.html>`__.

How to contribute
-----------------

The preferred way to contribute to FISSA is to fork the `main
repository <http://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/>`__ on GitHub.

1. Fork the `project
   repository <http://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/>`__. Click on the
   'Fork' button near the top of the page. This creates a copy of the
   code under your account on the GitHub server.

2. Clone this copy to your local disk:

   .. code:: bash

        git clone git@github.com:YourUserName/fissa.git
        cd fissa

3. Create a branch to hold and track your changes

   .. code:: bash

        git checkout -b my-feature

   and start making changes.

4. Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version
   control. When you're done editing, do:

   .. code:: bash

        git add modified_files
        git commit

   to record your changes in Git, writing a commit message following the
   `specifications below <#commit-messages>`__, then push them to GitHub
   with:

   .. code:: bash

        git push -u origin my-feature

5. Finally, go to the web page of your fork of the FISSA repo, and click
   'Pull request' to issue a `pull
   request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`__ and
   send your changes to the maintainers for review. This will also send
   a notification email to the committers.

If any of the above seems like magic to you, then look up the `Git
documentation <http://git-scm.com/documentation>`__ on the web.

It is recommended to check that your contribution complies with the
following rules before submitting a pull request.

-  All public functions and methods should have informative docstrings,
   with sample usage included in the doctest format when appropriate.

-  All unit tests pass. Check with (from the top level source folder):

   .. code:: bash

        pip install pytest
        pytest

-  Code with good unit test coverage (at least 90%, ideally 100%). Check
   with

   .. code:: bash

        pip install pytest pytest-cov
        pytest --cov=fissa --cov-config .coveragerc

   and look at the value in the 'Cover' column for any files you have
   added or amended.

   If the coverage value is too low, you can inspect which lines are or
   are not being tested by generating a html report. After opening this,
   you can navigate to the appropriate module and see lines which were
   not covered, or were only partially covered. If necessary, you can do
   this as follows:

   .. code:: bash

        pytest --cov=fissa --cov-config .coveragerc --cov-report html --cov-report term-missing
        sensible-browser ./htmlcov/index.html

-  No `pyflakes <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes>`__ warnings.
   Check with:

   .. code:: bash

        pip install pyflakes
        pyflakes path/to/module.py

-  No `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ warnings.
   Check with:

   .. code:: bash

        pip install pep8
        pep8 path/to/module.py

   AutoPEP8 can help you fix some of the easier PEP8 errors.

   .. code:: bash

        pip install autopep8
        autopep8 -i -a -a path/to/module.py

   Note that using the ``-i`` flag will modify your existing file
   in-place, so be sure to save any changes made in your editor
   beforehand.

These tests can be collectively performed in one line with:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r requirements-test.txt
    pytest --flake8 --cov=fissa --cov-config .coveragerc --cov-report html --cov-report term

Commit messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commit messages should be clear, precise and stand-alone. Lines should
not exceed 72 characters.

It is useful to indicate the nature of your commits with a commit flag,
as described in the `numpy development
guide <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/dev/gitwash/development_workflow.html#writing-the-commit-message>`__.

You can use these flags at the start of your commit messages:

    | **API**: an (incompatible) API change
    | **BLD**: change related to building the package
    | **BUG**: bug fix
    | **CI**: change continuous integration build
    | **DEP**: deprecate something, or remove a deprecated object
    | **DEV**: development tool or utility
    | **DOC**: documentation; only change/add/remove docstrings, markdown or comments
    | **ENH**: enhancement; add a new feature without removing existing features
    | **JNB**: changing a jupyter notebook
    | **MNT**: maintenance commit (refactoring, typos, etc.); no functional change
    | **REL**: related to releases
    | **REV**: revert an earlier commit
    | **RF**: refactoring
    | **STY**: style fix (whitespace, PEP8)
    | **TST**: addition or modification of tests
